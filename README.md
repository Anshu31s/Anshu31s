<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">🎓 I’m a Full-Stack Developer passionate about building practical, real-world applications that scale. With experience in MERN, Next.js, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, I specialize in creating end-to-end solutions—from intuitive frontends to efficient, robust backends and cloud infrastructure.
<br>
I’ve built applications including real-time chat platforms, AI-powered PDF assistants, school management systems, and ESP8266 integration projects. Whether it’s handling file uploads via S3 or Azure Blob, implementing real-time features with Socket.IO and WebSocket, or deploying containerized apps with Docker, I bring both breadth and depth to software development.
<br>
Driven by curiosity and ownership, I thrive in fast-moving environments where I can solve problems, design scalable systems, and ship reliable code. Always eager to learn, collaborate, and grow.
